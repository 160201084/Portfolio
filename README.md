Built feed-forward dense neural networks and convolutional neural networks to predict the speaker of an audio clip from 115 different speakers with a 99.8% accuracy and also predicted his/her gender with a 95% accuracy.

Built several binary classification models using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and redditâ€™s API to classify over 150k posts. Used tableau to visualize best models and parameters. Best model had an accuracy of 95% on validation data

Given data for house prices and about 80 features, I had to use my knowledge of python, pandas, matplotplib, seaborn, sklearn and others in order to generate accurate predictions and answer some business questions using statistical analysis.
