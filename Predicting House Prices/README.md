#### Summary of project:
We were given data for the house prices and about 80 features. We had to use our knowledge of python, pandas, matplotplib, seaborn, sklearn and others in order to generate accurate predictions and answer some business questions using statistical analysis. 

We cleaned the data <br>
Filled missing values <br>
Combined features <br>
Used engineering features like polynomial transformations <br>
Identified and dealt with outliers <br>
Made visualizations <br>
Split our data into training and testing data for fitting <br>
Used Linear Regression, Lasso, LassoCV, Ridge and Ridge CV <br>
Scored how good our models were <br>
Made predictions and submissions to kaggle <br>
Made business recomendations <br>



#### Conclusions:
We know that some features greatly affect the price of a house. Good overall and external condition are very important for the sale price. The kitchen quality is also a factor to seriously consider. Stone Brook and Northridge Heights is where we need to invest.
